### Motivation

Mexico is one of the biggest cities in the world and as such, it has a lot of different attarctions, neighbourhoods and of course, prices in Airbnb listings, our intention is to find the drivers of properties prices and finally to predict them.

### Project

The first thing done in this project was the formulation of 3 questions:
* Which neighbourhood is the more expensive?
* Which neighbourhood has more super hosts?
* Is there a relantionship between super hosts and price in the neighbourhoods?

The answer to each question can be found here.

The second stage of the project consists on finding other relationships within the data useful to predict the price of a property. This model can be found here.
