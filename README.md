### Motivation

Mexico is one of the biggest cities in the world and as such, it has a lot of different attractions, neighborhoods and of course, prices in Airbnb listings, our intention is to find the drivers of properties prices, you can find a a Medium post in [here](https://medium.com/@mtrejosantamaria/5-questions-i-wanted-to-answer-about-airbnb-in-mexico-223a0fd5aab6?source=friends_link&sk=6fbf162da54dc4b3356cf27c9837a722)

### Requirements

The database used in this notebook is in the file listings from this repository, data from different cities accross the globe can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

Since plotly graphs are heavy, the notebook may not load, it is important to clone the project in order to see and follow the results.

### Project

This project aims to answer 5 questions:
* Which neighborhood is the more expensive?
* Which neighborhood has more super hosts?
* Is there a relationship between super hosts and price in the neighborhoods?
* Why are these neighborhoods more expensive?
* Are there other variables that drive the price?

The answer to each question can be found [here](https://github.com/MauricioTrejo/AirbnbMX/blob/dev/Notebook.ipynb).
